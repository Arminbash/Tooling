### Known issues in Visual Studio 2019

When creating a new project Visual Studio may show you a yellow bar with the message 
"**ASP.NET Core 3.0 or newer projects are not supported by this version of Visual Studio**"

**Workaround:** You need to hit Cancel in OneAspNet dialog and then restart VS for the yellow-bar message to go away and ASP.NET Core 3.0 to show up in the dropdown. Simply cancel and re-open OneAspNet dialog without restarting VS does not fix the issue.
