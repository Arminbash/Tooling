# .NET Core 3.0 Preview 1

When creating a new project Visual Studio may show you a yellow bar with the message 
"**ASP.NET Core 3.0 or newer projects are not supported by this version of Visual Studio**"

**Workaround:** You need to hit Cancel in OneAspNet dialog and then restart VS for the yellow-bar message to go away and ASP.NET Core 3.0 to show up in the dropdown. Simply cancel and re-open OneAspNet dialog without restarting VS does not fix the issue.

To create or open applications targeting .NET Core 3.0, Visual Studio 2019 is required.
